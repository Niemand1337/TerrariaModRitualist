## Ideas

### Buff-Adjustment: Eyes On You Blessing
Change text by adding comment that it might guide some projectiles or so.
Make some projectiles homing, when they are shoot while having this effect (else not).

### Weapon: Cursed Weapon
Projectiles are anti-homing and try to evade enemys. Fly straight with Eyes On You Blessing.

### Weapon: Crimtane/Demonite Spear
Crafting: Crimtane/Demonite Bars and other stuff
Cost life on usage without dark blessing.
Shoots laser with Eye On You Blessing (So only good at post Cthulhu).
Laser pierces one time with Corruption Blessing.
Crimtane red and Demonite purple color for spear and laser.

### Accessory: Minor Dark Spellbookpage
On sacrifice shoots two the Minor Dark Spellbook in a 45 degree angle to the left and right top of the player

### Accessory: Eyes On You Blessing
Need an accessory that grants this blessing, as the Sacrifical Demonic Dagger will be outdated at some point.
Mabye be able to craft the accessorie with the dagger and some other accessorie.

### Accessory: Fiend's Contract
Flavor text like 'What is the worth of a soul anyway?' or "What is the worth of a soul - in face of true power?"
Summons an imp, shoots only when player has Dark Blessing.
Projectiles should be homing when player has Eyes On You Blessing.
Make sure that MinorCorruption armor pen. applies to imp as well.

### Accessory: Thorned Shackle
Crafting: Jungle thornes and shackle
3 Seconds after sacrificing life sacrifice an additional 5 life.
Prolongs sacrifical buffs another time and triggers on-sacrifice effects
Decreases armor by 2.
Decreases Jumpheigt by 7%
Warning:
Should not call itself.
Could be very strong compared to other items 

### Accessory: Corrupting Cuffs
Ã„quivalent to Magic Cuffs - Crafted from a (throned) shackle and a band (of Corruption).
Combine effects from both items - Lose some of the drawbacks (7% jumpheigt and 1 lifeRegen decrease)



## System

### Recipies
Missing for MinorDarkSpellbook.
Missing for BandOfCorruption



## Needed adjustments

### Sound rework
Currently every item usw has just a random sound. There are Items with missmatches sound, for example a sowrd with a shooting sound.

### Buff Icon
There is no time below the icons. There is an option for that but enabeling it leads to the time being shown to far down.
Reason for that is, that it appears below the image - which is 4 times longer than shown as it is animated and consists of frames.

### PurpleSphereProjectile
The projectile is to big - making it 2/3 or 1/2 the size would improve the visual.
With this adjustment there is an need to change the shootLaser function of it, as there the offset for the laser spawn must be adjusted to the new radius.

### PurpleLaserProjectile
Improve the visual - more research and testing with lasers is needed.



## Balancing

### Possible problem - "Worse sacrificial dagger is actually better" or "Using weapons without minor dark debuff is good"
Using an older sacrifical dagger leads t more frequent usage and a worse life to buff ratio, if one tooks the time to recast only on Darknes Blessing end.
Additionally one is missing out on the buffs from the better daggers - in return the accessories on-sacrifice effects will be cast in a shorter interval.
Needs to be consindered to prevent the effects from on-sacrifice to be as good to outweight using a better dagger.

### Minor Dark Spellbook
Strength values not tested and adjusted
