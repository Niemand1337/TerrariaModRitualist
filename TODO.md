## Ideas

### Accessory: Lengthen blessing effects
Add variable blessing_length_modifier to ModPlayer. Multiply value times base time when granting a blessing

### Buff-Adjustment: Eyes On You Blessing
Change text by adding comment that it might guide some projectiles or so.
Make some projectiles homing, when they are shoot while having this effect (else not)

### Weapon: Cursed Weapon
Projectiles are anti-homing and try to evade enemys. Fly straight with Eyes On You Blessing

### Accessory: Eyes On You Blessing
Need an accessory that grants this blessing, as the Sacrifical Demonic Dagger will be outdated at some point.
Mabye be able to craft the accessorie with the dagger and some other accessorie.

### Accessory: Fiend's Contract
Flavor text like 'What is the worth of a soul anyway?' or "What is the worth of a soul - in face of true power?"
Summons an imp, shoots only when player has Dark Blessing.
Projectiles should be homing when player has Eyes On You Blessing.
Make sure that MinorCorruption armor pen. applies to imp as well.



## Needed adjustments

### Sound rework
Currently every item usw has just a random sound. There are Items with missmatches sound, for example a sowrd with a shooting sound.

### Buff Icon
There is no time below the icons. There is an option for that but enabeling it leads to the time being shown to far down.
Reason for that is, that it appears below the image - which is 4 times longer than shown as it is animated and consists of frames.



## Balancing

### Possible problem - "Worse sacrificial dagger is actually better"
Using an older sacrifical dagger leads t more frequent usage and a worse life to buff ratio, if one tooks the time to recast only on Darknes Blessing end.
Additionally one is missing out on the buffs from the better daggers - in return the accessories on-sacrifice effects will be cast in a shorter interval.
Needs to be consindered to prevent the effects from on-sacrifice to be as good to outweight using a better dagger.
